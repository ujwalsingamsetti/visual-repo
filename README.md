# ðŸš€ Pipeline Editor â€“ DAG Builder

This is a React-based **Pipeline Editor** that allows users to visually create and manage **Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)**, simulating the construction of real-time data processing workflows using interconnected nodes.

> Developed as part of the **Frontend Intern Assignment** for **Nexstem**.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

To build a web-based visual DAG editor where users can:
- Add custom nodes via a UI prompt
- Connect nodes using directed edges
- Delete selected nodes and edges with keyboard interaction
- Validate the current structure as a **valid DAG** (no cycles, minimum 2 nodes, all connected)
- Auto-arrange nodes in a clean layout using a layout algorithm
